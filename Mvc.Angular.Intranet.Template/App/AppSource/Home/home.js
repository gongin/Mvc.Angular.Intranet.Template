 * For example, a `note` section could have the submodules `note.create`,
 * `note.delete`, `note.edit`, etc.

 * Regardless, so long as dependencies are managed correctly, the build process
 * will automatically take take of the rest.
 *
 * The dependencies block here is also where component dependencies should be
